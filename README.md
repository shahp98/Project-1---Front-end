# Project-1---Front-end
created using HTML + CSS + Bootstrap

This repository contains webpages without Back-end support.

A top-fixed navigational bar is used and you can navigate to different linked pages. On reducing the size of the window, a toggle button gets added on the bar which will contain all the tabs.

The Home page contains 2 posts.

The Contact Us page contains my email address and user-names to find me on GitHub and Instagram.
